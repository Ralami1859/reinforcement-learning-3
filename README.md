# Reinforcement Learning
This repository is based on some of the work I have done as a part of my student-led undergraduate class on Reinforcement Learning.

<br>
There are two projects:

1. A [Deep SARSA](https://github.com/gelanat/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/SARSA.ipynb) implementation.
2. A [Q-learning](https://github.com/gelanat/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/Q-learning.ipynb) implementation.

<br>
These are tutorials - you can find the accompanying step-by-step guide on Medium:

1. A tutorial on [Deep SARSA](https://medium.com/@gelana/learning-with-deep-sarsa-openai-gym-c9a470d027a).
2. A tutorial on [Q-learning](https://medium.com/@gelana/introduction-to-q-learning-with-openai-gym-2d794da10f3d?sk=a647b529955a1d9c319490aaf4347a2b).
